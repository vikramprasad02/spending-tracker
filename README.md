# spending-tracker

This repository houses all the files to develop my personal spending
tracker. Over time, it will come to add many of the features available
on MINT or AMERICAN EXPRESS. However, I'll be developing it and having
control.

At its base, it is just a classifier of my spending line items to see
how much I'm spending in a particular category.
